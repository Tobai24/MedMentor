The history of diabetes is crucial in this scenario, as diabetic cheiroarthritis is closely linked to long-standing diabetes mellitus."
RELEVANT,"The case prompt describes a 52-year-old female with localized lower back pain, which is initiated by a specific activity—lifting a heavy object. This aligns with the topic of musculoskeletal pain assessment. Additionally, the detail regarding the radiation of pain to her left buttock suggests potential nerve root involvement, as it may indicate radicular pain originating from lumbar nerve roots. The case includes important aspects for both assessment (sudden onset after an activity) and management (pain characteristics and radiation), making it fully relevant to the provided clinical context."
RELEVANT,"The case prompt describes a 67-year-old female with worsening pain in her right hip and thigh, associated with difficulty walking and stiffness in the morning, which clearly aligns with the topic of limb pain and musculoskeletal disorders. The symptoms presented—specifically the pain in the hip and thigh—are directly related to potential musculoskeletal conditions such as osteoarthritis or hip fractures, thus demonstrating a strong relevance to the input context."
RELEVANT,"The case prompt describes a 28-year-old male with lower back pain and morning stiffness that improves with activity, which are classic symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis. Additionally, the buttock pain radiating to the posterior thigh is consistent with the associated symptomatology of this condition, as it can indicate sacroiliac joint involvement. Overall, the details in the case prompt align well with the expected clinical presentation of ankylosing spondylitis."
RELEVANT,"The case prompt describes a 38-year-old male experiencing bilateral knee pain and morning stiffness for the past three weeks, with symptoms that improve with activity. This presentation is consistent with Spondyloarthritis, where morning stiffness and improvement with activity are common features. The involvement of the knees also aligns with the types of joint manifestations seen in both Spondyloarthritis and Psoriatic Arthritis, making the case prompt highly relevant to the provided clinical context."
RELEVANT,"The case prompt describes a 65-year-old female experiencing worsening pain in her right knee for the past 6 months, which is a common clinical presentation of osteoarthritis. The symptoms mentioned, such as knee pain exacerbated by activity and relieved by rest, align well with the typical characteristics of osteoarthritis. Therefore, this case prompt is directly relevant to the condition of osteoarthritis as both involve the same patient demographic and symptomatology."
RELEVANT,"The case prompt describes a 32-year-old female experiencing recurrent episodes of discoloration of her fingers in response to cold exposure, which is a classic symptom of Raynaud's phenomenon. The associated pain and numbness further support the likelihood of rheumatologic conditions, such as systemic sclerosis or other autoimmune disorders. Therefore, the case prompt is directly aligned with the input topic of Raynaud's phenomenon or rheumatologic conditions."
RELEVANT,"The case prompt describes a 68-year-old female with symptoms that are characteristic of polymyalgia rheumatica, namely bilateral shoulder and hip pain and morning stiffness lasting over an hour. These symptoms align perfectly with the typical presentation of polymyalgia rheumatica, which often involves significant pain and stiffness in the proximal muscles. Furthermore, the progressive worsening of symptoms over two weeks is also consistent with the typical course of this condition. Therefore, the output is fully relevant to the input."
