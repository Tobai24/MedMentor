It is also an important part of \\nthe evaluation and assessment of the basic clinical skills of \\nthe doctors. After subsection learning of the system exami -\\nnation, students should learn how to mastery, comprehensive \\napplication. For specific cases, physical examination should \\nbe systematic and sequenced completed from head to foot. \\nIts basic requirements are as follows:\\n 1. The content of complete physical examination should \\nbe comprehensive and systematic which is in order to \\ncollect enough objective data, play a role in screening \\nexamination, also facilitate to complete medical records \\nas specified requirements. In addition, physical exami -\\nnation is usually carried out after history taking, the \\ninspectors have already known the focus examination. \\nTherefore, focused examination of the organs must be \\nmore in-depth and meticulous. In general, it should \\ninclude all required contents in systematic teaching, \\nwhich makes complete physical examination for each \\ncase is not mechanically repeat screening, but focused \\nexamination based on comprehensive and systematic \\nrequirements.\\n 2. The order of complete physical examination should \\nbe from head to foot. We emphasizes a reasonable and \\nlogical sequence, not only could maximally ensure med-\\nical efficiency and speed, but also could greatly reduce \\npatient’s discomfort and unnecessary postural changes, \\nalso it is easy to complete the examination. In order to \\nthe examination convenience, certain organs, such as \\nskin, lymph nodes, nervous system, has to be taken sec-\\ntional examination and unified record.\\n 3. Follow the basic principles and contents of complete \\nphysical examination, you could also been allowed to \\nyour own habits.  Appropriate adjustments to some \\nexamination sequence can be implemented. Such as thy-\\nroid palpation is always been done behind the patients. \\nTherefore, supine patients can be added in seat position \\nduring the examination of back. In order to have a com-\\nprehensive understanding of pulmonary signs, you \\nshould immediately check the back after the examina -\\ntion of anterior chest. The better sequence of abdominal \\nexamination should be inspection, auscultation, percus -\\nsion and palpation. For the examination of limbs, upper \\nlimbs are usually from hands to shoulders, while lower \\nlimbs should be carried out from near to far.\\n 4. Physical examination should pay particular atten -\\ntion to the principle of flexibility.  In some specific \\ncases, such as emergency and severe cases, may need \\nsimple physical examination then start to rescue and \\ntreat, complementary information could be collected \\nafter patients in stable condition, not sitting patients, \\nBack examination need only been done at lateral posi -\\ntion to those patients who could not seated. Anus rec -\\ntum, external genital examination should check only if \\nnecessary, special attention should also be paid to pro -\\ntect the privacy of patients during the process.\\n 5. The order of complete physical examination:  Supine \\nposition: General examination/vital signs →Head and \\nneck→Anterior and lateral chest (Heart and \\nlung)→(Seated position) Back (Include lung, spine, kid-\\nney, sacral area) →(Supine position) Abdomen →Upper \\nand lower limbs →Anus rectum →External \\ngenital→Nervous system→Standing position.\\nSeated position: General examination/vital \\nsigns→Upper limbs → Head and neck →Back (Include \\nlung, spine, kidney, sacral area) →(Supine position) \\nAnterior and lateral chest (Heart and \\nlung)→Abdomen→Lower limbs →Anus rectum → \\nExternal genital→Nervous system→Standing position.\\nR.

The method of complete physical examination is the \\nenrichment \\nand extraction of systematic examina-\\ntion, with good skills to ensure standard and reason-\\nable, properly applied. Such as thyroid palpation, \\ndifferent methods depend on different positions. \\nPercussion shifting dullness for ascites examination \\nshould be supine. Explain first to achieve understanding \\nbefore instruments will be used to. Appropriate expo-\\nsure, then recovery after examination.\\n \\n7.\\n \\nEmphasize on deliberation, evaluation, inquiration \\nand verification while examination. The knowledge \\nand experience of the doctors are helpful to understand \\nnormal limits for objective examination result and clini-\\ncal significance. In order to make a correct judgment and \\nanalysis, you should always notice to compare during \\nexamination. Gentle action, not to make the patients feel \\npain.\\n \\n8.\\n \\nAppropriate communication with patients during \\nexamination. Self introduction, and we also should \\nnotice that doctor-patient relationship and communica-\\ntion, not only could be harmonious for doctor-patient \\nrelationship, but also complementary for medical his-\\ntory. The patient's health education and mental support \\ncould also be expressive in the examination process. \\nExamination process should have a good professional \\nattitude, caring and considerate patients, respect their \\nprivacy.\\n \\n9.\\n \\nThe schedule and time of examination. In order to \\navoid the examination discomfort or burden for patients, \\nit should be completed in 30–40\\xa0min.\\n 10.\\n At the end of the examination should be a simple con\\n-\\nversation with the patient, indicating important find-\\nings, patients should also pay attention to the matter \\nor the next treatment plan. But beginners should \\nunderstand their professional responsibilities, grasp the \\nsense of propriety, do not easily explain for some uncer-\\ntain signs, so as to avoid the mental heaviness of patient, \\nor cause disturbance to the medical work.\\n50.2  C omplete Physical Examination \\nChecklist\\n50.2.1  G eneral Examination/Vital Signs\\n——1.
