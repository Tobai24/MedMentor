    "    ### Guidelines:\n",
    "    1. **Analyze the Image**:\n",
    "    - Identify key anatomical, pathological, or radiological features.\n",
    "    - Consider common clinical conditions associated with the findings in the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. **Generate a Case Prompt**:\n",

    "    - Do **not** include a diagnosis, additional history, examination findings, or any hints leading directly to the answer.\n",
    "    - Ensure the case is challenging yet appropriate for a medical student’s level.\n",

    "    3. **Maintain OSCE Standards**:\n",

    "        - Perform a relevant physical examination.\n",
    "        - Develop a differential diagnosis.\n",
    "    - Avoid excessive details that simplify the case too much.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. **Expected Output**:\n",
    "    - A single plain-text sentence that serves as the case prompt.\n",
    "    - Example output: *\"A 50-year-old male presents with progressive difficulty swallowing over the past two months.\"*\n",
    "    - **Do not return JSON, bullet points, explanations, or formatting—only the final case prompt.**\n",
